# Stock Price Prediction Using RNN with LSTM
This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict stock prices based on historical data. The primary goal is to forecast Nifty 50 index prices using time-series analysis and neural network modeling.

# Overview
Predicting stock prices is a challenging yet rewarding task due to the inherent volatility of financial markets. This project implements RNN and LSTM architectures to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data, enabling more accurate predictions.

# Features
Preprocessing of historical stock data.

Neural network architectures:

Feed Forward Neural Networks (FNN).

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM.

Scaled and normalized data for optimal model training.

Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices.

Modular and reusable code for scalability.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and modeling.

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM nodes.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib: For visualizing stock price predictions.

Scikit-learn: For scaling and preprocessing the data.

# Results
The RNN with LSTM model captures temporal trends effectively, reducing prediction error by approximately 10% compared to simpler feed-forward networks. Below is an example of the actual vs. predicted price visualization:
